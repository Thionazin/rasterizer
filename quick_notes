[OBJ Files]
v is a vertice. v followed by three numbers, the coordinates.
f is face, it is the connections of the vertices. In order counter clockwise of vertice.

indexed by one.
ordering is important because of the right hand rule and normals.


[Parser Output]
In our case, it gives a list of vertices. Arranged by triangle.
posBuf is a list of triangles. It has groups of three vertices, each a face.

norBuf is a list of normals. One normal for each vertex in a face. Grouped by faces.
Normals are specified with vn
obj files require one normal per vertex

texBuf is the texture buffer. Again each piece is split up into three. Texture coordinates are 2d, there are two values for each vertex



ask about normal
